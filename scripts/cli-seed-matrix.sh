# Seeded RED/GREEN matrix for the locally provable CI lanes.
#
# Local runner, not a CI gate: for each seed it plants a defect, asserts the
# named lane command turns red AND names the seed, removes the seed, and
# asserts the lane turns green again. It never compares the tree against a
# committed count or list.
#
# Seeds: vet, lint, format, race, tidy, the 500-line cap, and the coverage
# floor (RED + GREEN each), plus `make lint` / `make filecap` exit-status
# checks on the Makefile recipes.
#
# Lane commands are the exact steps the pinned eshu-hq/.github go-collector-ci
# reusable runs (ci.yml calls it) plus the Makefile recipes that `make ci`
# uses. One deliberate substitution: the race profile goes to the temp dir
# instead of the repo. The floor checks run scripts/coverage-gate.sh, which is
# what `make race` runs; CI enforces the same floor through the reusable's
# coverage-floor input, which the script requires to equal the Makefile's.
# The govulncheck, gosec, shell, image and ci-complete lanes are not reseeded.
#
# Seed .go files live in the module root (package ciworkflow, the package ci_workflow_test.go already declares), outside the
# cmd/eshu and internal trees that scripts/check-nofork.sh governs. The
# cleanup trap removes them on every exit path.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/cli-seed-matrix.sh
# Needs: go, rg (ripgrep), golangci-lint v2.12.2 in GOPATH/bin. Race runs write
# large temp files (graphinstall tests): point TMPDIR at a roomy disk.
# Must leave the tree exactly as found: every seed is removed after its check.
